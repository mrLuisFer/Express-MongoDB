# ğŸŒ¿ Express-MongoDB ğŸŒ¿
ğŸŒŸThis is a repository where I upload the files that I learned to do a simple Rest API from a very simple BackendğŸŒŸ

## Aboutâœ¨
This is just a practice where I can use what I have learned to improve my Frontend applications

This is only the backendğŸŒŸ part, I have not done the backend yet since the idea was to create one for future or larger projects that need data management or things like that
